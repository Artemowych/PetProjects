## 2. Apply the free review technique:
Write down all the questions, bugs, inaccuracies, ambiguities that you find in the requirements (User story 1, User story 2, User story 3, User story 4 and App info)
But remember that for each page (User story 1, User story 2, User story 3, User story 4 and App info) there should be at least 2 points. Thus, in total you need to find at least 10 questions, bugs, ambiguities in the requirements.
## 3. Format the review results
